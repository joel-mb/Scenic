## CONSTANTS

## MONITORS

#    while True:
#        if withinDistanceToTrafficLight(ego, 100):
#            setClosestTrafficLightStatus(ego, "green")

## DEFINING BEHAVIORS
#behavior EgoBehavior(speed=10):
#    do FollowLaneBehavior(speed)

    try:
        do FollowLaneBehavior(speed)

#    interrupt when withinDistanceToTrafficLight(self, 15) and not changed:

#        changed = True

## DEFINING SPATIAL RELATIONS
# Please refer to scenic/domains/driving/roads.py how to access detailed road infrastructure
# 'network' is the 'class Network' object in roads.py

# make sure to put '*' to uniformly randomly select from all elements of the list, 'lanes'
lane = Uniform(*network.lanes)
